                <p class="pb-3 project-body">For my first project as a Software Engineer Intern at Paramount, I was tasked with creating a highly-requested API that would allow developers to easily log messages to a unified location when sections of their code were run. To do this, I created an API using AWS Lambda functions that would interact with CloudWatch to log messages. I then added functionality allowing engineers to send these messages to Slack by integrating with Slack's API. Because the rest of my team's tools followed a nautical theme, we named this Foghorn. Because Foghorn now had access to the Paramount Slack workspace, to make it more secure, I created an access management system using AWS API Gateway API keys, which users would be able to interact with via the Foghorn Slackbot. Keys automatically disable upon overuse to prevent accidental spam, but can be re-enabled (or created, deleted, and distributed) using the bot. To deploy Foghorn, I learned how to use the Serverless Framework, which made it simple to deploy development and production versions without interacting with the AWS console.</p>

                <p class="pb-3 project-body">As part of my music analysis work, I had the idea to analyze song lyrics through the lens of word sounds, as opposed to something like lyrical content. When starting this project, I realized that no dataset existed parsing lyrics by sound and decided to create one for myself. I also thought that a network connecting words by their shared sounds would be useful both for this project and potentially other related ones, which ended up becoming RhymeNet. To create this database, I started with the <a class="par-link align-self-center" href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMU Pronouncing Dictionary</a>, which contains the sounds used to pronounce over 134,000 words. Because syllable divisions are so important in song lyrics, I created an algorithm to automatically parse these phoenetic pronunciations of words into syllables based on the linguistic theory of <a class="par-link align-self-center" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00437956.1978.11435661" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"greedy onset clustering"</a> and added sections of the network connecting words by their shared syllables, vowel sounds, and rhyming endings.

On one of these nights, someone brought up the idea of building a website where we would be able to play together while living at colleges over 1,000 miles apart, which spawned the idea of trying to build a bot that could beat us. During Spring Break 2023, my friend <a class="par-link-inv align-self-center" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-strupp-51b82319a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam</a> and I decided to tackle the challenge. We started by mapping out on paper how we would model the game, then built that model in Python. The model included a player class, who would be able to take their turn by selecting from a list of allowed plays. Then, we were able to train the AI to play by simulating millions of games with other bot players. It works by evalutating all allowed moves and deciding after which one it has the highest chance of winning, based on it's training data. Using deep reinforcement learning, it is even able to generalize and make predictions in situations that it hasn't seen before. After a certain number of training episodes, we update the other bots the AI is simulated against to match the AI's current decision-making, increasing the strength of it's competition and forcing the bot to make smarter plays.

To rectify this, I found software that would let me see the exact inputs my laptop was registering when I pressed different buttons on my keyboard, then created scripts so that my computer would reinterpret those buttons as QWERTY keys before they were registered by the music software.

                <p class="pb-3 project-body">Over the summer, I had the very cool opportunity to intern at <a class="par-link align-self-center" href="https://www.paramount.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paramount</a> as part of the Tech Strategy team. As the team's Innovation Intern, my work primarily revolved around defining the innovation strategy for the Paramount+ and PlutoTV streaming apps. Using thorough research, I was able to assist with evaluating potential R&D initiatives and craft recommendations for tech innovation schemes. Later in the summer, I got to see some of my proposals through by joining a cross-functional team that worked to streamline the process for receiving executive buy-in for experimental projects. I was even asked to present some of my recommendations to the Paramount Streaming CTO, which was a great experience.</p>

I then worked cross-functionally to guide design and engineering teams in building out these features and others. As a backend software engineer, I was able to build out some of the features I defined while learning about the software development process.</p>

I think it turned out pretty well, don't you? :)</p>
