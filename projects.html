                <p class="pb-3 project-body">For my second big project as a Software Engineer Intern at Paramount, I was tasked with creating an application for ensuring that SCTE-35 cue messages are properly inserted into HLS and MPEG-DASH video streams. All of my team's apps have a nautical-themed title, so we decided to call this Spyglass, since that's what a pirate uses to look ahead see what's approaching before they reach it. The application started as a stripped-down version of another app that my team had built with a similar architecture, containing only the bare essentials to deploy with Docker and our CI/CD framework. I began by creating a Python/Flask backend to take in and parse encoded SCTE messages. To determine which sections of cue messages were necessary to consider given the project's goal of improving advertisement placement, I read (skimmed) through the 100+ page <a class="par-link-inv align-self-center" href="https://www.scte.org/standards/library/catalog/scte-35-digital-program-insertion-cueing-message/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SCTE-35 standard</a>. I then wrote code to verify and log the validity of incoming cues in an AWS DynamoDB, which required some thinking about how to design the data structure containing this information to allow for efficient lookup, and unit tests to make the application easier for my team to maintain after my internship ends. Because I was able to finish this project a couple weeks before my internship ended, I had the opportunity to integrate it with my team's main frontend monitoring system, a Next.js app using GraphQL. To do so, I created GraphQL queries to retrieve networks' logged cues, then displayed them in a React table, and added the ability for users to filter by date, time, and substring match.</p>
                <p class="pb-3 project-body">This project offered a ton of learning opportunities, both relating to the tools used to create it, and to digital video in general. For example, while debugging, I learned all about Docker and Kubernetes, which my team used to deploy all of our interconnected apps. I also wanted to take advantage of my time being on a team that focused on video distribution and delivery for the summer and learn all that I could about digital video. My great mentors shared lots of resources with me, and I spent a lot of time reading about and discussing all aspects of digital video, from how cameras work to encoding and compression to distribution to digital displays.</p>

                <p class="project-subhead">DESCRIPTION</p>
                <p class="pb-3 project-body">When I first got access to ChatGPT, what impressed me the most about it were its responses to prompts asking it to generate poems or song lyrics about a certain topic because of how it was able to rhyme line endings while maintaining a coherent message. However, it soon became apparent that there were some major limitations in ChatGPT's songwriting ability, and I had some ideas about how to improve it that I wanted to test out. For one, ChatGPT really likes to start verses with the words "listen up," which leads to some repetitive lyric generation across themes. More importantly, however, is that ChatGPT typically only rhymes words at the end of consecutive lines. While this is still very impressive at first, it doesn't really reflect how song lyrics typically rhyme, where throughout multiple lines words are connected by rhymes and matching vowel sounds that can stretch across multiple consecutive syllables. My first idea for a way to improve upon this was to fine-tune a GPT model by training it on a dataset of song lyrics. The GPT model that I used as a starting point was OpenAI's GPT-2, a predecessor to ChatGPT, which I chose because HuggingFace has a version of it's language modeling head available that is well-documented and something I could run on my own laptop.</p>
                <p class="pb-3 project-body">I then decided to try adding logic to the decoder that further boosts the number of internal rhymes generated by rescoring words during generation to boost the score of words that rhyme with what has already been generated. When a GPT model does language modeling to generate text, it generates new words one at a time by (essentially) assigning each word a probability that it gets generated next. SyllableGPT adds to the pre-probability scores of the most likely words for each of the internal rhymes and matching syllables they share with what has already been generated. To do this, it uses <a class="par-link align-self-center" href="#rhymenet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RhymeNet</a>, a previous project of mine. It also generates a "likely vocabulary" of what it expects to be generated in the future based on what it has already, and rescores words to a lower degree based on matches with the likely future vocabulary. In the future, I'd like to try implementing similar logic on a larger and more advanced language model in the hope of achieving more coherent results. I'd also like to figure out a way to work similar rhyme-generating functionality directly into the decoder logic in a way that can be trained directly with backpropagation.

I then added functionality allowing engineers to send these messages to Slack by integrating with Slack's API.

                <p class="pb-3 project-body">As part of my music analysis work, I had the idea to analyze song lyrics through the lens of word sounds, as opposed to something like lyrical content. When starting this project, I realized that no dataset existed parsing lyrics by sound and decided to create one for myself. I also thought that a network connecting words by their shared sounds would be useful both for this project and potentially other related ones, which ended up becoming RhymeNet. To create this database, I started with the <a class="par-link align-self-center" href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMU Pronouncing Dictionary</a>, which contains the sounds/phonemes used to pronounce over 134,000 words. Because syllable divisions are so important in song lyrics, I created an algorithm to automatically parse these phoenetic pronunciations of words into syllables based on the linguistic theory of <a class="par-link align-self-center" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00437956.1978.11435661" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"greedy onset clustering"</a> and added sections of the network connecting words by their shared syllables, vowel sounds, and rhyming endings.

On one of these nights, someone brought up the idea of building a website where we would be able to play together while living at colleges over 1,000 miles apart, which spawned the idea of trying to build a bot that could beat us. During Spring Break 2023, my friend <a class="par-link-inv align-self-center" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-strupp-51b82319a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam</a> and I decided to tackle the challenge. We started by mapping out on paper how we would model the game, then built that model in Python. The model included a player class, who would be able to take their turn by selecting from a list of allowed plays. Then, we were able to train the AI to play by simulating millions of games with other bot players. It works by evalutating all allowed moves and deciding after which one it has the highest chance of winning, based on it's training data. Using deep reinforcement learning, it is even able to generalize and make predictions in situations that it hasn't seen before. After a certain number of training episodes, we update the other bots the AI is simulated against to match the AI's current decision-making, increasing the strength of it's competition and forcing the bot to make smarter plays.

                <p class="pb-3 project-body">In my free time, I love to make music with my MIDI keyboard. I always found it strange, though, that my keyboard had buttons that weren't used by the music creation software it came bundled with, and that the same software had QWERTY keyboard shortcuts that weren't playable with my MIDI one. To rectify this, I found software that would let me see the exact inputs my laptop was registering when I pressed different buttons on my keyboard, then created scripts so that my computer would reinterpret those buttons as QWERTY keys before they were registered by the music software. The code will work for anyone with the same keyboard, and can be found <a class="par-link align-self-center" href="https://github.com/stevenwinnick/SessionViewMIDI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> along with instructions for using it.</p>

This project combined many of the concepts we'd learned about in the class with ideas from Computer Vision. It began with a pre-trained CNN that constructed a vector encoding representation of images. These were then fed as inputs into a generative language model of stacked BiRNNs, which at each step output the probabilities of each word in the training dictionary being the next word in the caption. I then implemented a Beam Search algorithm to output the most likely caption.</p>

After 3D-printing and assembling the robot, we cut up and soldered cables to wire the electronics and installed an onboard computer. We used Bash scripts to configure the computer to send us an email with it's IP Address upon startup, allowing us to control our robot remotely with an SSH connection. I did some <a class="par-link align-self-center" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_kinematics#Numerical_solutions_to_IK_problems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">math</a> to figure out how to rotate the servo motors to give us a smooth walking path, then wrote some error-handling code to control all 8 servos simultaneously and let our robot walk.</p>

It can also scale to contain any number of hidden layers, each of any size, that it is initialized with, and accepts both batches and individual inputs.

As the team's Innovation Intern, my work primarily revolved around defining the innovation strategy for the Paramount+ and PlutoTV streaming apps. Using thorough research, I was able to assist with evaluating potential R&D initiatives and craft recommendations for tech innovation schemes. Later in the summer, I got to see some of my proposals through by joining a cross-functional team that worked to streamline the process for receiving executive buy-in for experimental projects. I was even asked to present some of my recommendations to the Paramount Streaming CTO, which was a great experience. After my internship ended, work continued on this project by my team at Paramount continuing to build processes based on information we had researched together. I was super excited to hear about the company hackathon that happened when I was back in school, which had over 400 participants, and especially that several of the ideas from the hackathon had continued to receive support and be built out into new Paramount streaming features.</p>

As a backend software engineer, I was able to build out some of the features I defined while learning about the software development process.
